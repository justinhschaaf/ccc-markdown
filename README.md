# CCC Markdown

This is a test project/proof of concept designed to allow lessons to be parsed from markdown using styling from [CCC](https://mm909.github.io/CCC/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.3.

### To Do

- Properly implement `<section>` tags so that automatic Table of Contents generation works

- Add support for tabbed code blocks (see [this example](https://mm909.github.io/CCC/#0Test1))

- CCC Colored Text (textR, textG, textB, etc...)
